# Previz Camera Tools

Previz Camera Tools sets up the Sequencer to control the camera view selection in the 3D View on frame updates. Which makes it possible to edit the clip timings(on sequencer on the same screen and at the same time as editing cameras and everything else in the 3D Viewport.

# Run the script
 1. Run the script in the text-editor or install it though the User Preferences.   
 2. Find the functions in the bottom of the right-hand-side
    properties menu of the 3D View.

# Functions
 "Link Sequencer to 3D View" will link the 
 framenumber and switch cameras in the 3D View. So playing 
 the sequencer will play the sequence in the 3D View. So 
 the camera work of the 3d scene can be edited instantly.

 "Add Camera to Sequencer" will add a scene strip
 in the Sequencer with the current camera starting from the
 current frame.

 "Walk Navigation" (native Blender function) will give f.p.s. 
 camera control. Shortcuts: q,w,e,a,s,d
 
 "Add Camera to View" by Rockbard will turn the view port
 into a camera. Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+Num_0
 
 "Cycle Cameras" by CoDEmanX will cycle between cameras. 
 Shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right arrow.
 
 "Camera Renamer" shows current camera and allows to rename it. 
 

# Troubleshooting 
 - Jitter in the Sequencer playback means hit "Refresh Sequencer" button. 
 - Only scene strips are supported for previw in the 3D View. 
 - And only cameras from the current scene can be shown in 3d View. 
   (This is a limitation of Blender. There is only one scene pr. 
   Screen) 

# Ideas for more functions(currently out of my coding skills) 
 - Set in and out points(of the current camera) - to be inserted at playhead in Sequencer. 
 - Select Strip > Select Camera & update 3D View(select cameras through Sequencer) - as a checkbox 

# API trouble
 - Suggest API feature to access local scenes in Sequencer
